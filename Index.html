The curriculum is interdisciplinary, combining elements of business, technology, and innovation to prepare students for the dynamic world of digital entrepreneurship. Key topics include the development of online business models, such as e-commerce stores, digital marketplaces, and subscription-based services, which allow students to understand how to operate businesses primarily or entirely online.

The course also covers the technical and operational aspects of setting up and managing online stores on platforms like Shopify, Amazon, and eBay, including logistics, payments, and customer service.
    <br><br>In addition, the curriculum emphasizes the creation and monetization of digital products and services, such as software, mobile apps, online courses, and digital content, as well as digital services like consulting and virtual assistance. Emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT), are introduced to illustrate how they can be leveraged to create innovative products, services, and business processes.
    <br><br>The course also addresses the global reach of digital businesses, teaching students how to operate ventures that can reach an international audience without the need for a physical presence in multiple locations, thereby enabling remote work and collaboration. Additionally, it focuses on digital transformation, guiding students on how to help traditional businesses transition to digital operations by adopting digital tools and strategies to enhance efficiency, customer experience, and competitiveness.
    <br><br>Practical components such as projects, case studies, and interactions with industry experts are integrated into the course to provide real-world insights and hands-on experience. By the end of the course, students are expected to have a solid foundation in digital entrepreneurship, equipped with the skills to launch and scale digital businesses effectively in the fast-paced digital economy.
